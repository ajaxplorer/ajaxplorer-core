New Features
**************

[Pydio Booster]

Pydio Go is a complement to Pydio that runs as a Server. It is based on GO, a performant language developed by Google. It will improve overall software performances, by delegating CPU-consuming task to this new tool. In this first version, it will handle uploads, scheduler triggers, and best of all, one-click install websocket server, which will especially improve scalability and performances by pushing events from server instead of polling all the time.
Pydio Go is available for Pydio Community and Pydio Enterprise.

[File Gateway improves your server security]

Pydio offers a brand new SaaS-based service called FileGateway, a host proxy to send public links without disclosing your server URL. Choose your domain name (filesend.cc / yoursha.re) and your region (US / EU).
Online Documents Edition

By hosting your own instance of Libreoffice Online from Collabora and using our new connector, you can now edit any office documents directly online, without the need to use third-party services like Zoho.

[API, Performances]

- Full rewrite of Pydio API, especially regarding provisioning, following Open API standards; there is now an extensive, accurate API REST documentation.
- Increased caching, especially files list, whick makes it mindblasting in terms of performances, especially for remote workspaces like S3 or FTP
- Search for files or information across several storages / workspaces at the same time, and get quicker search results with the upgrade of our Elastic Search plugin
- New Admin parameter to easily allow or prevent user to re-share files

[Under the Hood]

- Code refactoring, with PSR-7 pattern, Composer, Guzzle
- New Messaging Server based on NSQ, a language originally developed by Bitly
- Auto-complete command line makes it easier for Admins to look for specific actions with Pydio (thanks to @symfony)
- End of some unmaintained plugins (e.g. auth.serial, conf.serial)
- Internal router embeded solves deployment issues, simplifying RewriteRules at maximum
- New way of storing shares that will facilitate Pydio migrations
And many more... !!

****************
Migration Checks
****************

Appart from the Pydio core code, in-app upgrade process has modified a couple of resources. If you encountered any error, here is a list of the specific changes in this version.
Database Upgraded: you can verify that the following new tables were created : ajxp_tasks, ajxp_tasks_nodes, ajxp_mq_queues
.htaccess file updated : the RewriteRules are now greatly simplified.
Public links are now served directly from the /public/ endpoint. For backward compatibility, the file /data/public/share.php should have been modified as well. Please verify that your links are still working correctly.
/conf/bootstrap_*.php files were modified. If you have any changes, they may have been overriden.
S3 plugin now embeds its own Aws SDK. Plugin configuration should have been switched to v3 automatically.
