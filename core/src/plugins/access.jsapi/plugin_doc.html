<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> If you installed Pydio by the linux repository ( apt / yum ), you must install the "pydio-plugin-access.jsapi" package.</p>
<p>Browse the javascript Classes and Interfaces (in the ajaxplorer-extended prototypejs sense) detected in the living application, and display their method and JSDocs. This is again a good demonstration of how Pydio can be used at something totally different from browsing a filesystem : there the datamodel is loaded locally.</p>
